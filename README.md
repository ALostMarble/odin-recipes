# odin-recipes
A basic recipe site.

This project is a test of my html skill. I will properly commit, organize, and save different pages of a website that shows recipes. I haven't done this in a bit, but I can do it. Ha ha.

I'm doing this at the NYPL. The NYPL is pretty nice. They killed it with this one. 

-Update: I'm at home now. It's been three weeks since I last worked on this. I'm trying again. Ha.

-Update 2: After a long break, I'm here to finish this once and for all. Ha ha ha.
