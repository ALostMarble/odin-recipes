  <h1>Steps</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Separate the beef into 4 equal portions, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers. Gently roll each portion into balls then press down into round patties that are slightly larger than your bun to allow for shrinkage (12 cm / 4.7" wide, 1 cm / 0.4" thick for a 10cm / 4" burger bun).</li>
    <li>Preheat the grill to high. Place the bread cut face up on a tray and toast for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. (If using BBQ, place cut face down on the grill). Set aside.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle one side of patties with half the salt and pepper. Flip, then press a dent into the middle of each patty. (Prevents patties doming when cooking and reduces shrinkage!). Sprinkle this dented side with the remaining salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Put 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot – smoking hot!</li>
    <li>Cook 2 to 4 patties (whatever fits in the pan) for 1 1/2 minutes. Press down lightly with a spatula (not too hard else the meat juices squeeze out!). Flip, then immediately top with a slice of cheese. Cook for another 1 1/2 minutes (cheese will melt by itself!) then transfer burgers to a tray to rest for 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Slather the base of the bun with your sauce of choice. My order of assembly:</li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Lettuce</li>
      <li>Tomato</li>
      <li>Burger (x 2 for double!)</li>
      <li>Gherkins</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Sauce on bun lid</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Jam it on top of the stack.</li>
  </ol>
