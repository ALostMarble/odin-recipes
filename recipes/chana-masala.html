  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    As one of the most popular dishes in the world, both in and out of India and
    Pakistan, channa masala (or chana masala, chole masala, or chholay,
    depending on where you're from)—chickpeas cooked in a spicy and tangy
    tomato-based sauce—is the kind of dish that stirs passions in the
    recipe-writing community. Questions of what aromatics to use, how to treat
    the spices, and fresh versus canned tomatoes are grounds to completely
    disqualify a recipe from the fickle realm of authenticity. Of course, if you
    ask two people what constitutes an authentic version of the dish, you may
    get two opposite answers. Onions, the Browner the Better Almost all channa
    masala recipes start with an aromatic base of onions, garlic, ginger, and
    chiles. The onions are typically browned until just before they start to
    burn and turn bitter. Unlike with a traditional French onion soup, in which
    the onions are cooked slowly enough to become candy-sweet in the process,
    here we're looking for browning with only mild sweetness. We also want the
    onion to break down fully, which helps lend body to the sauce later on.

    <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>

      processor into a paste.
    </li>

      Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in hot

      Pour the paste into the skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate
      from the mixture and is golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes.

    <li>
      Season the mixture with chili powder, coriander, gram masala, turmeric,
      and salt; cook and stir until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir enough water into the mixture to get a thick gravy; bring to a boil
      and stir chickpeas into the gravy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduce heat to medium and cook until the chickpeas are heated through, 5
      to 7 minutes.

    <li>Garnish with cilantro.</li>
