<h1>Chana Masala

Ingredients

US Customary – Metric
3 Tbsp grape seed oil (or sub coconut oil)
1 medium white or yellow onion, finely diced
1 Tbsp ground cumin
3/4 tsp sea salt (divided // plus more to taste)
6 cloves garlic, minced (6 cloves yield ~3 Tbsp)
2 Tbsp fresh ginger, minced
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
2-3 fresh green chilies, sliced with seeds (I used serrano peppers // reduce amount if you prefer less heat)
1 Tbsp ground coriander
1 tsp chili powder
1 tsp ground turmeric
1 28-ounce can pureed or finely diced tomatoes (if unsalted, you’ll add more salt to the dish)
2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, slightly drained
1 tsp garam masala* (see instructions for DIY blend)
2-3 tsp coconut sugar
2 Tbsp lemon juice (plus more to taste)
Instructions

Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, cumin, and one-third of the salt (1/4 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).
Add garlic, ginger, cilantro, and green chilies to a mortar and pestle and grind into a rough paste (or use a small food processor to pulse into a paste. Alternatively, just finely mince.) Then, add to the pan with the onions.
Next add ground coriander, chili powder, and turmeric and stir to coat. Add a little more oil at this point if the pan is looking dry.
Next add pureed tomatoes and chickpeas and remaining salt (1/2 tsp as original recipe is written). If the mixture looks a little too thick, add up to 1 cup (240 ml) water (I added ~1/2 cup (120 ml) // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). You’re looking for a semi-thick soup consistency at this point, as it will cook down into more of a stew.
Increase heat to medium high until it reaches a rolling simmer, then reduce heat to low or medium-low and maintain a simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes, or until thick and stew-like. Stir occasionally.
In the meantime, if you don’t have garam masala seasoning, make your own by adding (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) 2 small dried red chilies, 1 tsp black peppercorns (or 1/2 tsp ground black pepper), 1 tsp cumin seeds (or 1/2 tsp ground cumin), 1 tsp cardamom pods (or 1/2 tsp ground cardamom), 1/2 tsp cloves (or 1/4 tsp ground cloves), and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind/mix into a powder. Set aside.
When the chana masala is thickened and bubbly, taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt for saltiness, chili powder for heat, or a bit of coconut sugar for sweetness and to offset the heat of the chilies.
Remove from heat and add lemon juice and garam masala. Stir to mix, then let cool slightly before serving. Fresh cilantro and lemon juice make an excellent garnish. Chana masala can be enjoyed as a stew on its own, or it can be delicious with white or brown rice (see my favorite method here), or cauliflower rice. Lastly, my favorite is over roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli (see notes for instructions).
Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month.

    <p>As one of the most popular dishes in the world, both in and out of India and Pakistan, channa masala (or chana masala, chole masala, or chholay, depending on where you're from)—chickpeas cooked in a spicy and tangy tomato-based sauce—is the kind of dish that stirs passions in the recipe-writing community. 
    Questions of what aromatics to use, how to treat the spices, and fresh versus canned tomatoes are grounds to completely disqualify a recipe from the fickle realm of authenticity. Of course, if you ask two people what constitutes an authentic version of the dish, you may get two opposite answers.
    
    Onions, the Browner the Better

    Almost all channa masala recipes start with an aromatic base of onions, garlic, ginger, and chiles. 
    The onions are typically browned until just before they start to burn and turn bitter. 
    Unlike with a traditional French onion soup, in which the onions are cooked slowly enough to become candy-sweet in the process, here we're looking for browning with only mild sweetness. 
    We also want the onion to break down fully, which helps lend body to the sauce later on.</p>
